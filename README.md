# kotlin-beginner (Functional Programing:)

Functional Programing is style of structuring your program where the focus is to transforming data with expression which should not have side affect.
Kotlin is perfect blend of Object-Orianted and functional programing paradigms. It brings both worlds closer together

FP is a style of building the structure and elements of programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
 -  Each input has just one output
 -  FP, by its nature , is thread safe and immutability has a great role in making it thread safe.
 - A function that uses or return other function is Higher Order Function
 - First class Function allow to use Function as variable, Parameters, returns, generalization types and so on.
------------
Pure function:
------
  - Don’t have side effect, not memory, nor IO
 Recursive Function:
  - Function that invoke themselves, with some sort of condition to stop the execution
  - They maintains a stack but can be optimized with trailres modifier 
 Side Effect
    On computer programing, when a function modifies any object/data outside its own code , the is called side affect
 .

- In kaitlin when you are declaring property as function, you should mention the datatypes of parameters/agruments inside braces , followed by an arrow and then the return type of function.
