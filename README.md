# kotlin-beginner (Functional Programing:)
## Kotline Introduction 
Kotlin is Programing langauge developed by JetBrains. It runs on Java Vartual Machine.

### Why Kotlin?
 #### Statically Typed :
  This means that the type of every variable and expression is known at compile time.it doesn’t require you to explicitly specify the type  of every variable you declare
 #### Concise
It drastically reduces the amount of boilerplate code that you have been writing all the time in other OOP languages like Java.,Using Kotlin allows you to cut off the lines of code by approximately 40% (compared to Java).
 #### Open Source
Kotlin is distributed under Apache License, Version 2.0. The Kompiler (Kotlin compiler), IntelliJ IDEA plugin, enhancements to basic Java libraries and build tools all are open source
 #### Safe
Kotlin is safe. It avoids the most dangers of null references from the code  and annoying NullPointerExceptions by supporting nullability as part of its type system.
 #### Functional and Object Oriented Capabilities
 - Functional Programing
Functional Programing is style of structuring your program where the focus is to transforming data with expression which should not have side affect.
- FP is a style of building the structure and elements of programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- Kotlin is perfect blend of Object-Orianted and functional programing paradigms. It brings both worlds closer together

## Developers: Getting Started

```sh
# Install Homebrew (see https://brew.sh).
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# Install Java 8.
brew tap caskroom/versions
brew cask install java8

# Checkout the monorepo:
git clone https://github.com/AnerayeVijay/kotlin-beginner.git
```
### Running the Applications

- Go inside `kotlin-beginner`
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
  1. Tell it to overwrite `.idea`, then revert all changes IntelliJ made to that directory
  2. You can run the test cases through IntelliJ or
   run ```gradle build``` from terminal or commandprompt
